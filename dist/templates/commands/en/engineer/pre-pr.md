# Preparation for Pull Request

This command validates that everything is ready to create Pull Requests.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Complete implementation (all tasks from `/plan` executed)
- All commits made
- Clean and organized workspace

## 📋 Project Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always read the project configuration files BEFORE running this command!**

### Required Files

1. **`context-manifest.json`** (orchestrator root)
   - List of project repositories
   - Roles of each repository (metaspecs, application, etc.)
   - URLs and dependencies between repositories

2. **`ai.properties.md`** (orchestrator root)
   - Project settings (`project_name`, `base_path`)
   - Task management system (`task_management_system`)
   - Credentials and specific configurations

### How to Read

```bash
# 1. Read context-manifest.json
cat context-manifest.json

# 2. Read ai.properties.md
cat ai.properties.md
```

### Essential Information

After reading the files, you will have:
- ✅ Complete list of project repositories
- ✅ Location of the metaspecs repository
- ✅ Base path to locate repositories
- ✅ Configured task management system
- ✅ Project-specific configurations

**🛑 DO NOT proceed without reading these files!** They contain critical information for the correct execution of the command.


## 🎯 Objective

Ensure that the implementation is complete, tested, and ready for review before creating PRs.

## 🛑 CRITICAL: WHERE TO WORK

**⚠️ ATTENTION: ALL CODE (tests, fixes, adjustments) MUST BE CREATED INSIDE THE WORKTREE!**

**✅ CORRECT** - Work inside the worktree:
```
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/src/file.ts  ✅
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/tests/test.ts  ✅
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/.eslintrc.js  ✅
```

**❌ WRONG** - NEVER create code outside the worktree:
```
<orchestrator>/.sessions/test.ts  ❌
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/test.ts  ❌
{base_path}/<repo-name>/test.ts  ❌ (main repository!)
```

**ABSOLUTE RULE**:
- 🛑 **ALL code** (tests, fixes, configurations) **MUST be in** `<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/`
- 🛑 **NEVER modify** the main repository in `{base_path}/<repo-name>/`
- ✅ **Work ONLY** inside the worktree of the specific repository

## ✅ Validation Checklist
