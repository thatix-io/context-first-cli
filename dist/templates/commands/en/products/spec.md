# Specification Creation (PRD)

This command creates the complete specification (Product Requirements Document) for the feature.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This Command DOES NOT Implement Code

**This command is ONLY for requirements documentation:**
- ✅ Create PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- ✅ Update issue in the task manager via MCP
- ✅ **READ** files from main repositories (read-only)
- ❌ **DO NOT implement code**
- ❌ **DO NOT edit code files**
- ❌ **DO NOT checkout branches in main repositories**
- ❌ **DO NOT make commits**

**Next step**: `/start` to begin development.

---

## Configuration

Read `context-manifest.json` and `ai.properties.md` from the orchestrator to get repositories, base_path, and task_management_system.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Issue refined via `/refine`
- Approval to proceed with the feature

## 📚 Load MetaSpecs

**Automatically locate MetaSpecs**:
1. Read `context-manifest.json` from the orchestrator
2. Find the repository with `"role": "metaspecs"`
3. Read `ai.properties.md` to get the `base_path`
4. The metaspecs are located at: `{base_path}/{metaspecs-repo-id}/`
5. Read relevant `index.md` files to ensure compliance with:
   - System architecture
   - Design patterns
   - Technical constraints
   - Project conventions

## 🎯 Objective

Create a complete PRD that will serve as the single source of truth for implementation.

## 📄 Saving the PRD

**PRIORITY 1: Use MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

- Read `ai.properties.md` from the orchestrator to identify the `task_management_system`
- Use the appropriate MCP to update the issue with the PRD:
  - Add the complete PRD as a comment on the issue
  - Or attach as a file (if the task manager supports it)
  - Update status/labels (e.g., "spec-ready", "ready-for-dev")
- Inform the user: "✅ PRD added to issue [ID]"

**FALLBACK: Create .md file only if MCP fails**

If MCP is unavailable or fails:
- Save to `./.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/prd.md`
- Inform the user: "⚠️ PRD saved locally in .sessions/ (task manager not available)"

## 🔍 Review and Approval

Before finishing:
1. Review the PRD with stakeholders
2. Validate against metaspecs (if available)
3. Obtain approval to start implementation
4. **Via MCP**: Update the issue in the task manager with status "Ready for Development"
5. **Fallback**: Document approval in `./.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/prd.md`

## 🎯 Next Step

After PRD approval:

```bash
/start
```

This command will start feature development.
